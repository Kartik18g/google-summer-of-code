</div>

This summer, I was pleased to get selected for Google Summer of Code'21 under the organization [Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat). Working under the organization, my project was to **Introduce SpeechToText capabilities into Rocket.Chat as a standalone Rocket.Chat App**.


## üìô Abstract

[Rocket.Chat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-elements) is a modern team chat and collaborating platform written in full-stack JavaScript offering a full featured rich team chat experience on modern browsers, comparable to Slack and Microsoft Teams. Mobile and desktop clients run on iOS, Android, MacOSX, Windows, and Linux. It is one of the largest active open source (permissive MIT source license) nodeJS communications platform communities on GitHub with more than 12Million users worldwide.


Rocket.Chat users have an option of sending audio files or live audio messages to a room or a chat. My project introduces a new native Rocket.chat app that utilises the capabilities of [Rocket.Chat.Apps-Engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine) and allows the user to be able to not only transcribe the audio files but also save the transcript  as metadata. This whole functionality is built packaged into a Rocket.Chat.App, which can be configured to use the transcription provider of user's choice.

## üìù Deliverables

The deliverables of the project are as follows:

- [x] To be able to transcribe the audio files on server side & store the transcript metadata on demand.
- [x] Create an efficient API to be able to queue/get transcripts.

- [x] Design & Develop an interactive app interface.
  - Utililsed [Rocket.Chat.Fuselage Monorepo](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Fuselage/tree/develop/packages/fuselage-ui-kit) for creating App components.
- [x] Provide the User and option to choose from a variety of API providers for trascription. Currently supported providers are:
  - Assembly AI.
  - Mcirosoft Cognitive Services .
  - & Rev AI.

- [x] Write flexible code so that it's easy to add support for a new provider in the future.

All of the listed deliverables were completed within the GSoC period. YAY !! üéâ

## üì¶ Working product

The work can be found here - [App on Github](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.SpeechToText). Please refer to the Readme.md for setup.

**I have also written a blog on how it works attached [here](https://reactnativeelements.com/blog/2021/08/12/auto-generation-of-docs).**

## üöÄ Contributions
This is a standalone app built over [Rocket.Chat.Apps-Engine](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-engine) & [Rocket.Chat.Apps-Cli](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-cli), which can be installed for free from the Rocket.Chat Apps marketplace. It is not a part of the core Rocket.Chat but lives inside the codebase, been provided with the maintainer rights i didn't need to create PR's so here are the commits that sum up the project.
